# Purpose of the system
Plant parenthood is a term developed by the millennial generation. It refers to those who 
adopt and care for house plants and develop a family of greenery in an indoor space. From 
the year 2016 to 2021, searches for ‘Indoor plant’ increased over 500%, particularly over 
Covid-19 pandemic, but why is it that people have become infatuated with their ‘plant 
children’?

It has been known for generations that plants reduce stress. Microbes in soil have been found 
to have similar properties as the infamous antidepressant, Prozac [1]. Plant owners inhale the 
corresponding Mycobacterium vaccae bacteria, that has a serotonin inducing effect, and 
continue to feel the positive effects of it.

There has also been further research in plants improving indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide is 
the most present greenhouse gas emitted through human activities in our atmosphere. These 
gasses are known for trapping heat around our Earth and are causing extremely damaging 
effects to the environment around us, including rising sea level, land degradation, and rising 
temperatures to name a few. More than ever the general population is trying to do their bit by 
reducing their individual carbon footprints, and since plants respire by absorbing carbon 
dioxide and producing fresh oxygen, owning a house plant is a great place to start transferring 
to a more carbon neutral lifestyle.

Furthermore, there is flexibility and creativity in plant ownership. There are hundreds of 
varieties of plant, that include flowers, succulents and trees. Most importantly, there are many 
natural foods and herbs that can be grown within the comfort of your own home and be used 
in recipes or eaten raw. Not only is this sustainable living, but it also creates a sense of 
achievement, by nourishing your body with food that has been developed organically, without any external chemicals, and no exploitation of workers, the plant owner is 
contributing to something much larger than just a plant, but also a socially impactful way of 
life.
However, although there are many associated benefits, becoming a plant parent is not as 
simple as it sounds. Plants are high maintenance, and it is not uncommon for people to treat 
plants as a temporary decorative instillation, rather than an introduction of the natural world 
into their living space. Often people who are unable to care for their plants have external 
commitments and cannot schedule time to allocate towards the up-keep of the plant. The APE
(Automatic Plant Environment) system solves this problem by removing all the hassle of the 
caregiving aspect and allowing the owner to reap all the benefits of home greenery.
The APE system measures the external temperature and humidity of the area surrounding the 
plant, and then produces useful graphics and analytics that allow the owner to understand the 
factors that are contributing to their plants growth. This data is displayed visually on the 
device and is also collected onto an SD card for the user to extract whenever they like. The 
key selling point of the APE is the self-watering feature. By doing live analysis on the 
collected data, the system can determine whether the plant requires watering and then pumps 
water into the soil automatically, with no input from the user. Furthermore, the APE has a 
corresponding arrow that points to the surrounding area of the plant that is exposed to the 
most light. Since, plants need light to photosynthesise, this useful component will let the user 
optimise the growth of their plant by being able to understand the best way to position it in 
their home.
By lowering the barrier to entry of becoming a plant owner and taking away the stress of 
management, the APE system allows for people to have all the benefits of plant ownership
without any of the pressure of being a bad plant parent.
